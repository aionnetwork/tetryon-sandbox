# Why Do This?

We have a submodules folders, to collect all the dependencies that were used to generate the artifacts used in this workbench. 

The submodules are pointed to the branch and height at which the artifacts were generated. 

This is here mostly to document where the artifacts came from:

* avm -> artifacts/avm/*
* bn128-jni -> project/native/libbn_jni.so
* zokrates -> artifacts/zokrates
